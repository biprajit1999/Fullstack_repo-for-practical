    Front-end web development is everything involved in programming the user 
    interface of a web application. Typically it refers to the Hyper Text 
    Markup Language(HTML), Cascading Style Sheets(CSS), and javascript portion
    of  web site production as opposed to the  database and server-side 
    programming. It encompasses everything from building a simple page of HTML
    text to creating complex, responsive HTML5 websites designed to be 
    accessed via various different browsers device and screen sizes.
